# Product Requirements Document: Site Optimizer

## Introduction/Overview

Site Optimizer is a React-based web application that provides comprehensive website analysis and optimization recommendations. The application allows web developers to enter a URL, which is then analyzed across multiple dimensions including accessibility, content quality, SEO, performance, security, and conversion rate optimization (CRO). The goal is to provide actionable insights that help developers improve their websites holistically.

## Goals

1. Provide a fast, comprehensive website analysis in under one minute
2. Identify critical issues across accessibility, SEO, performance, security, and CRO domains
3. Deliver actionable recommendations for each identified issue
4. Present analysis results in a clear, well-organized interface
5. Generate branded, downloadable PDF reports
6. Limit site crawling to a maximum of 20 pages to ensure performance

## User Stories

1. As a web developer, I want to analyze my client's website quickly so that I can identify optimization opportunities without extensive manual review.
2. As a web developer, I want to see accessibility issues so that I can ensure my website complies with WCAG standards.
3. As a web developer, I want to understand if my site's content aligns with its purpose so that I can better communicate with my target audience.
4. As a web developer, I want to identify SEO opportunities so that I can improve search engine rankings.
5. As a web developer, I want to optimize my site for large language models so that my content performs well in AI-powered search experiences.
6. As a web developer, I want to identify performance bottlenecks so that I can improve site speed and user experience.
7. As a web developer, I want to detect security vulnerabilities so that I can protect my site and its users.
8. As a web developer, I want to discover CRO opportunities so that I can improve conversion rates.
9. As a web developer, I want to download a branded PDF report so that I can share findings with clients or colleagues.

## Functional Requirements

### URL Input and Site Scraping

1. The system must provide a clean, prominent input field for entering the target website URL.
2. The system must validate the URL format before proceeding with analysis.
3. The system must use Playwright MCP to crawl and render the target website.
4. The system must limit crawling to a maximum of 20 pages per website.
5. The system must display a loading screen with progress indicators during analysis.
6. The system must complete the entire analysis process within 1 minute.

### Analysis Features

7. The system must analyze websites for WCAG accessibility issues.
8. The system must evaluate content alignment with the site's intent/purpose.
9. The system must identify SEO opportunities.
10. The system must identify LLMO (Large Language Model Optimization) opportunities.
11. The system must measure and report site speed performance metrics.
12. The system must detect security vulnerabilities in site files and versions.
13. The system must identify Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) opportunities based on Baymard research.

### Results Display

14. The system must organize results into clear sections for each analysis type.
15. The system must display each identified issue in a card format.
16. The system must prefix problem statements with a red "‚ùå" symbol.
17. The system must prefix solution recommendations with a green "üü¢" symbol.
18. The system must include "Learn More" links for additional information on each issue.

### PDF Export

19. The system must generate downloadable PDF reports of the analysis results.
20. The system must include product branding and the analyzed URL in the PDF reports.

### Configuration and Security

21. The system must use environment variables for all API keys and sensitive credentials.
22. The system must validate the presence of required environment variables on application start.
23. The system must provide clear error messages when required environment variables are missing.

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. The application will not provide backend services or require user authentication.
2. The application will not store analysis results on a server.
3. The application will not automatically implement the recommended changes.
4. The application will not analyze more than 20 pages per website.
5. The application will not provide real-time monitoring of websites.
6. The application will not perform competitive analysis against other websites.
7. The application will not perform penetration testing or advanced security scanning.

## Design Considerations

1. The interface should follow a clean, modern design with ample white space.
2. Analysis results should be organized in collapsible sections for each analysis type.
3. Color coding should be used consistently: red for problems, green for solutions.
4. The loading screen should include engaging visuals and clear progress indicators.
5. The PDF report should maintain the same visual hierarchy and organization as the web interface.

## Technical Considerations

1. The application should be built using React with TypeScript.
2. The application should be deployed as a client-side only application.
3. Integration with the following APIs:
   - Anthropic API (Claude) for content analysis
   - Builtwith.com API for technology stack identification
   - PageSpeed Insights API for performance metrics
   - Playwright MCP for web scraping and rendering
4. PDF generation should be handled client-side.
5. The application should be optimized for deployment on Vercel.

## Success Metrics

1. Analysis completion time consistently under 1 minute
2. At least 90% of identified issues have actionable recommendations
3. PDF reports are properly formatted and branded
4. User-reported satisfaction with the comprehensiveness of the analysis

## Open Questions

1. What specific WCAG compliance level should we target (A, AA, or AAA)?
2. Should the application provide severity ratings for identified issues?
3. What specific metrics should be used to evaluate LLMO effectiveness?
4. What is the desired format and style for the product branding in the PDF?
5. Should the application provide an option to ignore certain types of issues?
